The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\n\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an 6 with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the 6 for what it is, the 6 becomes faint to the creature."~6~9~1~16~4~16~1~0~0~0~0~1~1~a bit of fleece
