Booming Blade~ As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails./n/nOn a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves be- fore then, it immediately takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.\r\n\r\nThis spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels.\r\n\r\nAt 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.~5~8~1~1~2~13~3~0~0~0~1~0~1~A weapon

On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.\r\n\r\nIf you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\nThis spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).~7~7~1~1~2~20~1~0~0~0~1~1~0~None

The change lasts for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n•   You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.\r\n\r\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.~8~9~1~7~1~17~2~0~0~0~0~1~0~None
Create Bonfire~You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube.

A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.~5~9~1~7~4~20~1~0~1~0~1~1~1~a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm
Druidcraft~Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:\r\n\r\n•   You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.\r\n\r\n•   You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.\r\n\r\n•   You create an 1, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk.

Encode Thoughts~You pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.\r\n\r\nIf you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as Detect Thoughts or Modify Memory), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.\r\n\r\nCasting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting Detect Thoughts on the strand has the same effect.)~4~9~1~7~8~1~6~0~0~0~0~1~0~None

Green-Flame Blade~As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and green fire leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.\r\n\r\nThe spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.~5~8~1~1~1~13~3~0~0~0~1~0~1~a weapon

Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn’t move.\r\n\r\nThe spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).~2~3~1~1~1~16~4~0~0~0~1~1~1~a living flea

The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.\r\n\r\nIf you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.~5~2~1~7~6~2~1~0~0~0~1~0~1~a firefly or phosphorescent moss

You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.\r\n\r\nThe hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.~2~9~1~7~4~16~1~0~0~0~1~1~0~None
Magic Stone~You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker’s, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Hit or miss, the spell then ends on the stone.\r\n\r\nIf you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any pebbles still affected by it.~8~7~2~2~4~2~2~0~0~0~1~1~0~None
Mending~This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.\r\n\r\nThis spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.~8~9~4~7~1~2~1~0~0~0~1~1~1~two lodestones
Message~You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.\r\n\r\nYou can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.~8~9~1~7~2~20~1~0~0~0~1~1~1~a short piece of copper wire
Mind Silver~You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw.

Minor Illusion~You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The 6 also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.\r\n\r\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.\r\n\r\nIf you create an image of an object--such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest--it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\r\n\r\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an 6 with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the 6 for what it is, the 6 becomes faint to the creature.~6~9~1~7~4~16~1~0~0~0~0~1~1~a bit of fleece
Mold Earth~You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:\r\n\r\n•   If you target an area of loose earth, you can 1ly excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.\r\n\r\n•   You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n•   If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.\r\n\r\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-1 effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.~8~9~1~7~1~16~2~0~0~0~0~1~0~None
